## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Flexbox & Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This was great practice in pre-planning the layout due to hidden components like the lightbox, checkout cart and mobile menu. Figuring out where to place these items took some time. There was a lot of JavaScript learning with this challenge with respect to all the interactive buttons. I'm not sure if having so many eventListeners is a performance issue even if the code is "correct".

The navigation hover effect for the desktop view was also a learning moment. Getting the hover effect to show-up well below the navigation links took a lot of patience and testing because of the impact on the heading.

I also used more inlined SVGs for the icons rather than wrapping them with images easily style them. Alternatively, the `filter` property was very helpful with minor styling if I wanted to use an SVG as the source for an `img`.

I'm most proud of the JS code I created for toggling the fade effect when switching product images in mobile view. This also took time and tinkering to figure out, but I was pleased when I did.

Bonus: First time using JavaScript to disable an event based on the window size. ðŸ˜Ž
