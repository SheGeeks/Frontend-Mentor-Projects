## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a great challenge to practice using CSS Grid, which is a lot of fun when using template areas. Really enjoyed the challenge of creating the layered card designs and adding the accents. Also, I learned which property to use when needing to change the hover color for SVG that's not inlined (hint: it's `filter`).

At first, I was a little stumped about how to approach switching the stats according to which link was clicked, but I figured it out and created little helper functions to keep my code DRY. Lastly, I think this is the first time I've used `foreach` in JavaScript that didn't involve a tutorial and truly grasped what the hell I was doing. Progress.

### Continued development

- CSS Grid
- Javascript
