## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Mobile first workflow
- A11Y

### What I learned

Started with a mobile first workflow, then uickly structured the provided content with HTML and styled with CSS for mobile layout. This design was great practice for styling SVG graphics and making accessible forms. One thing I tried and succeeded at with this challenge was using CSS only for client-side validation error. 

### Continued development
- SVG graphics
- Accessibility
- Form validation and errors
