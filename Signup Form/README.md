## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process
Started building mobile design first with Flexbox for layout. Added form using CSS Grid and validation code for form fields. Moved on to desktop design, adding appropriate styling for desktop viewing.

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid (Form only)

### What I learned

I didn't need to use CSS Grid for the form, but I always appreciate playing with both Flexbox and CSS Grid in the same designs. Doing so allows me to get a better understanding of the differences and limitations using either one.

Learned a lot more about form validation techniques.
