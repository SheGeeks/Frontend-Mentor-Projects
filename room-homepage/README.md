## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first
- CSS3
- CSS Custom Properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

About halfway through working on this, it dawned on me that I could've used CSS Grid instead of Flexbox to save myself some time.

I also wish I would've planned a little better for applying DRY HTML to the shop now section, but once I style the layout close to perfection I don't like to alter the structure of the HTML. Lesson learned, but I may take some time in a few weeks to correct this.

Was brave enough to use `clamp()` on the heading font, which I really enjoyed the result of and will try to incorporate more in the future.

Also, I always love an opportunity to use `picture` for responsive images and enjoyed the challenge of combining this with a slider.

### Continued development

- Applying DRY principles and doing better planning beforehand to save myself a lot of time.

- Accessibility: I'm pretty sure this isn't the most accessible code and I want to improve that.

- Animations: Will add a few animations in the near future.

- `Clamp()`: Researching if this can be used on padding/margins.

### Useful resources

- [`Clamp()` (MDN)](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp()>)
