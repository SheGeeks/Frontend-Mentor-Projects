## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process
Started building mobile design first with Flexbox. Added form using CSS Grid and classes/IDs for form field validation. Moved on to adding styling for desktop responsiveness and form in CSS3. Lastly, I added client-side validation to the form and a custom error message with an accompanying image using JavaScript.

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid (Form only)
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- I always appreciate playing with both Flexbox and CSS Grid in the same designs. Doing so allows me to get a better understanding of the differences and limitations with using either one.

- Learned a lot about client-side form validation using JS rather than HTML5 validation features. Felt there was a lot more flexibility with what I could create in this approach, especially with the error messages.

### Continued development

Looking forward to learning more JS that can be applied here such as clearing the error messages when a user focuses on an input field to try again. Also looking forward to digging into accessibility after using aria-labels for the first time with this challenge.
