## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The toughest part of the project was positioning the background elements. Experimenting with different values gave me a really insightful and thorough look into positioning background images. I also got more hands-on experience with using vh/vw units for sizing, which was fun to play with! Lots of challenges and practice with managing collapsing margins. Feedback welcome on any of these points.

### Continued development

I plan to spend a little more time digging into background positioning because it was such a challenge with this project, but also very insightful.
