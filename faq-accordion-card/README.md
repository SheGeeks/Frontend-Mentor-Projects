## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- A11Y

### What I learned

This was challenge was great practice with using multiple backgrounds, positioning properties, and creating an accessible accordian. With accessibility top of mind, I leveraged W3's design pattern example for an accessible accordian to create my own, mainly their JavaScript code. While coding the HTML and CSS was a breeze. I had a lot of fun working with mutiple backgrounds in this project. JavaScript was a lot more challenging than I anticipated. W3 really came to the rescue for that part.

### Continued development
- JavaScript
- A11Y
- CSS Position
