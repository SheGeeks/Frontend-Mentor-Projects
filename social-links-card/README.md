## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Flexbox
- A lot of üíù

### What I learned

Had so much fun adding the hover effects for this challenge and playing with different settings to land on the current styling. I'm especially proud of the squiggly line added to the Frontend Mentor link. Since this challenge defaulted to a dark theme, I added a light theme and toggle to access both themes.
