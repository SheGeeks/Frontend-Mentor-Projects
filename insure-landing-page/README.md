## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- JavaScript (mobile navigation only)

### What I learned

Another great exercise in using multiple background images. I do wonder if it'll ever get any easier. After completing this challenge, I feel a lot more knowledgeable about how they work, especially when it comes to placement on top of another element and in or out of a div container.

I also learned how to work with repsonsive images using the `picture` tag, which was very convenient for this challenge.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs: Responsive images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) - Always a helpful reminder on how responsive images work and another way to implement image switching across screen sizes when the images are the same.
