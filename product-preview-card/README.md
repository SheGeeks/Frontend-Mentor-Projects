## Overview

### The challenge

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- Responsive & Mobile Ready
- Flexbox
- Intrinsic Design (media-query free)

### What I learned

For this component I focused on creating an instrinsic layout for this component, reducing the need for media queries and allowing the design to respond fluidly to various screen sizes.

I'm proud to have accomplished this. However, things get tricky when accounting for flexible padding/margins, which I chose not to dive into with this component. _If it ain't broke, don't fix it._ The simplicity of the code works well across different screens.
