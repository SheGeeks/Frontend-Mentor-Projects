## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- A11Y


### What I learned

This challenge was great practice with using multiple images. I really enjoyed planning this layout the most because there's so many ways to tackle split layouts. I choose to use flexbox on most of the layout for responsiveness and speed. I also experimented with using `picture` to switch the header images on desktop and mobile. In order to be able to clip the image when viewing on a desktop, I did not continue using `picture`. Still, I got a greater understanding of how to use it moving forward.

### Continued development
- JavaScript
- A11Y
