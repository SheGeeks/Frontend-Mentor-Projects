## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 / Flexbox

### What I learned

Took on this challenge as practice for centering containers (or cards in this case). Always appreciate a simple challenege to practice the basics. Also, got a better understanding of how each value of `box-shadow` impacts its look during this challenge.

### Acknowledgments

Was reminded of a [helpful comment on one of my previous solutions](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/single-price-grid-component-css-grid-lxnu2Mk40) and want to acknowledge how awesome using `min-height` is to avoid cutting off centered content in portrait and landscape viewing on mobile devices.
