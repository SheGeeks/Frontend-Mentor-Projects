## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Fluid Typography
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- [Sortable](https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable) (for drag and drop)

### What I learned

There was a lot of learning with this project. While the HTML was simple, the CSS and JS were a challenge. In fact, I did a lot of things for the first time with this project:

- Creating a custom checkbox with gradients
- Using [Sortable](https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable) to implement drag and drop
- Creating a dark mode theme
- Using color scheme data with JS
- Changing caret color

I also got to explore the viewBox property more with the SVGs, which was fun. I took time to dig into accessibility around the inputs. Using `clamp()` was helpful to avoid adding styles to change font sizes at scale. I also added a few animations for completing tasks and deleting them, which was new for me. However, I very much want to continue digging into using CSS animations.

Overall, this was a great CSS and JavaScript challenge, exactly what I was looking for to continue building my skills in both.

### Continued development

- Improving attribute selection and structure in HTML and CSS
- CSS Animations
