## OVERVIEW

### THE CHALLENGE

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## MY PROCESS

Started building the mobile design first with Flexbox. Added form using CSS Grid. Moved on to adding responsive styling for desktop view. Lastly, I added client-side validation to the form and a error message with an accompanying image using a combination of CSS & JavaScript.

### BUILT WITH

- HTML5 | Semantic markup
- CSS3 | Flexbox, Media Queries
- JavaScript
- A11Y <sup id="a1">[1](#fn1)</sup>
- Mobile-first workflow
- üíù

### LESSONS LEARNED

 - **Update (4/8/21)**: After receiving feedback from <a href="https://github.com/grace-snow">@grace-snow</a> in the Frontend Mentor Slack channel, my solution is now responsive AF and the error indicators properly adjust with the inputs in all orientations. Grace also introduced me to the `:invalid` psuedo class to easily position the error indicator images correctly.

-  **Update (4/8/21)** I am no longer using CSS Grid on this form. <br>~~I always appreciate playing with both Flexbox and CSS Grid in the same designs. Doing so allows me to get a better understanding of the differences and limitations with using either one.~~

- Learned a lot about client-side form validation using JS rather than HTML5 validation features. Felt there was a lot more flexibility with what I could create in this approach, especially with the error messages.

### CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT

- Javascript form validation
- CSS form validation
