## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- Accessibile mobile menu
- Responsive & Mobile Ready
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This challenge reminded me of how powerful CSS Grid is, especially for complex layouts like this. Using Grid made this ridiculously easy to setup for desktop and mobile devices.
