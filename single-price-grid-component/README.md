## My process

### Built with

- CSS Grid
- A11Y
- Mobile-first workflow
- HTML5 Semantic Markup

### What I learned

This is my first frontend mentor challenge built almost entirely with CSS Grid. I do wish there was an easy way to center a grid container horizontally and veritcally without using flexbox. If you know of a way that could work with my solution, let me know!

Used grid-areas and grid-templates to create this layout in no time for mobile and desktop. CSS Grid made this challenge a breeze. I may go back and code it using Flexbox just to see if that changes the difficulty for me.

### Continued development

Using CSS Grid more. I really feel Grid might be easier to work with over Flexbox in some cases, espeically for responsive design.
